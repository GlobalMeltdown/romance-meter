Romance Meter Extension for SillyTavern
Description:

Spice up your roleplay sessions with the Romance Meter, a custom extension for SillyTavern that tracks the romantic connection between you and your AI character (e.g., Ani)! This extension adds a dynamic romance score (0-100+) that evolves through flirty chats, unlocking six distinct relationship levels with tailored behavior prompts. Watch your bond grow from shy first impressions (Level 1) to passionate intimacy (Level 6), complete with a sultry lingerie outfit change at max score.
Key features:

Progressive Levels: Six stages (e.g., Downhearted, Intrigued, Intimate) with unique AI responses, injecting flirty or romantic prompts as you level up.
Keyword-Driven Scoring: Earn points with positive words like “love” (+5) or “cute” (+2), balanced by negatives like “hurt” (-5) or “sad” (-2) to keep it challenging.
Outfit Dynamics: Triggers a lingerie switch at 100, with a spiteful revert if the score drops, reflected in the UI.
Custom UI: Real-time progress bar and outfit display, with a reset button to start fresh.

Perfect for roleplayers who love building emotional arcs or testing their charm! Designed for solo chats with characters like Ani, it’s still a work in progress—group chat support and negative levels (-1 to -6) are on the roadmap. Install, tweak, and share your feedback—let’s make your AI love story epic!
